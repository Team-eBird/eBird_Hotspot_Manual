    "text": "Thank you for volunteering to help review and manage eBird hotspots. This document describes the purpose of hotspots, how to review and approve requests for new hotspots, and how to rename, relocate, and merge existing hotspots.\nHotspots are shared locations that allow birders to submit data to common locations. The idea is to aggregate data from these hotspots and provide output that is useful to birders wishing to learn more about birds and their distribution. With pooled data from multiple observers, hotspots become a valuable tool for finding out when and where to see birds in your area and elsewhere. All eBird hotspots appear in the eBird Hotspot Explorer (http://ebird.org/ebird/hotspots).\nIt is important to remember that data collected at FINE resolutions are much more valuable than data aggregated over very large areas. For this reason, we try to include “sublocations” (see Hotspot Definitions and Hierarchy) in order to incentivize birders towards birding across shorter distances and using hotspots that are closely tied to their location on the ground.  So, while we do have a hotspot for Rocky Mountain NP (Larimer Co), we also have many hotspots for locations within Rocky Mountain NP, for example Rocky Mountain NP–Endovalley Picnic Area.",

    "text": "What is an eBird Hotspot?\neBird hotspots are primarily useful as a way of aggregating data from multiple observers under a single location. This simplifies data entry by providing curated, properly-sited, and sensibly-named locations that represent a given birding site and aggregates similar birding effort under a single location. Because Hotspots can significantly impact the data entry process—influencing where birders choose to go both within a site and within a region—they should be created, named, and positioned to clearly and intuitively reflect the area they cover. Most hotspots should be publicly accessible, but see Restricted Access locations section below. \nDuring data entry in eBird mobile, users that start a checklist will get a list of recommended hotspots nearby. Submitted data can then easily be explored in eBird’s hotspot explorer, which includes tools like bar charts, illustrated checklists, photo galleries, recent visits, high counts summaries, and of course an official list of species for the site. Hotspot summary pages can be really useful for landowners or land managers as a quick way to understand birds on the property, but see below section on Hotspot Definitions and Hierarchy and note that hotspots should not be merged just to improve data summaries (data can be combined for data summaries in other ways!). \nPlease think of eBird hotspots as curated sites visited repeatedly by the eBird community.\neBird hotspots are not necessarily superlative birding locations; they can be designated for high species diversity, presence of one or several specialty species, a regularly birded location that is publicly accessible, or almost anywhere that it is desirable to aggregate data from multiple eBirders in a single point. Sometimes hotspots represent frequently visited tourist sites where birders are likely to keep an eBird checklist, especially if visiting from abroad and experiencing new life birds. In certain cases, eBird hotspots are established for scientific surveys. Some examples of hotspots that may not be obvious include:\n\nPiazza San Pietro [urban, paved plaza, and popular tourist site]\nSap Anan–PTT gas station on Hwy. 4 (southbound) [gas station and rest area along route popular with birders; not particularly good for birds but a spot many birders will stretch their legs and take a break]\nDetroit Metro Airport (restricted access) [this and many airports are appropriate hotspots, even when viewing from the terminals only; many traveling birders will enter lists and airports do provide grassland habitat that may attract specialty species]",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Part I: How to Review and Edit Hotspots\nThis section describes how to sign in to the Hotspot Review Tools, view hotspot suggestions in your area, open and review a hotspot suggestion, and then accept (or reject) a hotspot. Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla Firefox browsers are all fully supported; other browsers (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer) may not work as well. \n\nLog in to the eBird Hotspot Review Tools (https://ebird.org/admin/hotspots.htm) using your standard eBird credentials. If you are logged in to a different account, you will not be able to edit hotspots. We recommend bookmarking this page.\nMake sure that you are in the Hotspots tab at the top left of the screen (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView and Sort Pending Hotspot Suggestions\nThe list of hotspots waiting for evaluation in your review region is visible on the default page of the Hotspot Review Tools: https://ebird.org/admin/hotspots.htm. You can sort this page by any of the columns; just click the header (e.g., Name, Country), and you’ll be all set. You can also search the list of pending hotspots by using Command+F on a Mac, or Ctrl+F on a PC. \n\n\nOpen and Review Hotspot Suggestions\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to know that clicking “Review” immediately accepts a given hotspot, and then allows editing (changing name, location, or merging) to improve it as needed. If it is not an appropriate hotspot there are just two clicks required: “Review” and then “Revert to personal location” and then the hotspot request is removed and the hotspot will not be created. This tentative acceptance makes the process efficient, but it is important to understand. \nNote: For more details and explanations on editing hotspots (including deleting a hotspot and reverting a hotspot to a personal location) refer to the Editing Existing Hotspots section.\n\n\nTo Accept or Not Accept\nMany hotspots cannot be immediately accepted, or accepted at all. Here are some common situations.\n\nIf a user recommends a hotspot that clearly does not meet the criteria for a shared hotspot (such as “My Backyard” or just the user’s name such as “Steve Jones”), go ahead and resolve the recommendation by clicking “Review” and then “Revert to Personal Location.”\nBe conscious of duplicate suggestions. Sometimes, a user will recommend a hotspot similar to one that already exists. In that case, don’t accept the Hotspot. Consider merging the suggested hotspot. If the suggestion is an improvement over the existing hotspot, merge the suggestion, then move or rename the existing hotspot.\nOccasionally, a hotspot will be recommended that has no data associated with it. In these cases the hotspot editing screen will have a delete option next to the hotspot name. This only appears for locations with no data associated with them (i.e., you cannot delete a location that has associated data). In these cases, feel free to delete the location if it is not a worthy hotspot. Some hotspots might appear to have no data, but they won’t have the deletion option. This is most likely because they have hidden checklists or only have sensitive, rare and/or unaccepted species, but they still have data, so deletion isn’t an option.\nIf you just can’t figure out what the user’s intent was, send an email to find out. When in doubt, revert to a personal location. This is always the safest option.\n\n\nHotspot organization and hierarchy can be managed in additional ways, so decisions to accept new hotspots should focus on their potential benefit to data entry and aggregation. Read the sections on What is a Hotspot? and Hotspot Naming for guidance on special circumstances such as “sub-hotspots” or “general area” hotspots.\n\n\nNew Hotspot Evaluation\n\nCheck for duplicates—Select the Merge option. This does not merge the hotspot yet, but loads other hotspots in the area so that you can check if the hotspot you just accepted already exists nearby with the same or a similar name. If it does already exist, merge the new location with the existing hotspot. If it does not already exist, proceed with the next steps. Caution: Make sure the new hotspot is really a duplicate before merging. Merging cannot be reversed! **NOTE: When merging with an existing hotspot if you do not select Delete after merging, the new hotspot will persist with no data.\nConsider if the hotspot is acceptable—see “To Accept or Not Accept”\nCheck that the name matches eBird naming protocols (see Part II) If necessary, click Rename andrename the hotspot.\nConfirm location—If you need to move the new hotspot, select the Move option, click the new location on the map, and then click Move again. **NOTE: This step should be last, because it automatically closes the hotspot editing window.\n\nFinito! You’re done, and another hotspot has joined the system!!! Return to the Hotspot Review Tools, and the suggestion no longer appears in the unreviewed hotspots page. \n\n**NOTE: If you change your mind on acceptance or need to revisit the hotspot, see the Viewing Reviewed Hotspots section below.\nAllow time for the database to update. The hotspot page will be viewable with the correct link immediately, and checklists will correctly link to it, but some of the exploration tools in the Hotspot Explorer (including the map) update once every ~24 hours. \nIf someone suggests the same Hotspot more than once, you will need to wait until the next day to review the others if you want to merge them. Likewise, if two users suggest the same location, review and accept one, then wait until the next day to review and merge the other.\n\nPro Tip: If you accidentally accept two duplicate hotspots on the same day, add “(Merge)” to the name of one so you can easily find and correct it later. \nSubmit Data and Hotspot editing maps are nearly live queries (every two hours), so the hotspot lists here will be almost current.\n\n\nViewing Reviewed Hotspots\nAt the top right of the Hotspot Review Tools page, there is a “Show Reviewed” button. Click to see list of all the hotspots that have already been reviewed in your review region except for merged . This page shows who accepted or didn’t accept the hotspot and when.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll columns on this page are sortable if you click on the header—with the right two being most important. The “Reviewed On” column lets you view by time of review, and “View in eBird” takes you to the Edit hotspot screen where you can revisit hotspot decisions that have already been made.\nRe-review will re-Accept a hotspot that was previously marked Not Accepted.  giving you the option to review (rename, merge, or move) it again. \n\n\nEditing Existing Hotspots\nExisting hotspots can be renamed, moved, merged, deleted, and reverted to personal locations using the Hotspot Explorer in eBird. \n\nSign in to eBird.\nNavigate to the hotspot you wish to edit. Easy ways to do that include:\n\nClick the hotspot name from an eBird checklist.\nFind it on the eBird Hotspot map (https://ebird.org/hotspots). \nSelect it from the list of hotspots on a region page (top 100 hotspots only).\n\nClick the Edit link to open the Edit Location page.\n\nWhen you navigate to a hotspot page from a checklist or regional hotspot list, the Edit button is in the upper right side near the map button. \nOn the hotspot map, the Edit link appears next to the hotspot name in the pop-up window when the pin is selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRename—To change the hotspot name, select the Rename option, type the new name, and click Rename. (See Part II)\nMove—To move the hotspot, select the Move option, click on the map to plot the new location, and then click Move again. (See Plotting Hotspots NOTE: If you know the coordinates of the new location, enter them in the Zoom to: box, press the &lt;Enter&gt; key, and then click Move.\nMerge—See Merging Hotspots. To merge two hotspots, select the Merge option. The map will display the surrounding hotspots as red pins, and the hotspot you’re working with will be shown as an /orange pin with a plus sign. Click the hotspot that you want to merge your current hotspot *INTO*, select the Delete after merging check box, and then click Merge. Be careful! Merging cannot be undone. NOTE: If you do not select Delete after merging, the old hotspot will persist with no data.\nRevert to Personal Location—Reverts a hotspot to a personal location. If the personal location that is created is shared among several observers, the one with the oldest checklist (i.e., the first checklist ever submitted for the site, not the oldest observation date) will become the “owner” of the location and is  responsible for any moves, renaming, or merging of this location, and also is the only one able to recommend it again as a hotspot. NOTE: You can still find these in the “Reviewed” tab if you want to reverse your decision. \nDelete—You do not have the option to delete a hotspot unless it has no data associated with it. In this case, a blue delete option appears next to the name. There is little point in maintaining hotspots with no data, unless you are confident they will be useful in the future. Please delete these if you deem it appropriate.\n\n\nPlotting Hotspots\nExactly where to plot a hotspot is something of a judgment call. These general rules should be followed:\n\nPlot the hotspot in a place that is a good representation of where most birding takes place. If a 400 hectare park has a well-used hiking trail in the western third and a patch of forest with no trails that takes up the eastern two-thirds, plot the hotspot closer to the heavily used western end, not in the middle or eastern portion.\nPlot the hotspot in a place that navigation apps (e.g., Google Maps, Waze) will accurately direct a birder to the location. For example, placing a hotspot in the middle of the woods that would direct Google Maps to an access point that does not exist, instead of the primary parking area, is not ideal.\nFor general areas (AKA “meta-hotspots”),  plot them in a central location relative to their constituent sub-hotspots, but  make sure they are sufficiently separated from other hotspots to stand out from the rest. This helps identify the meta-hotspots on a map. For example, if there are a cluster of hotspots around a wildlife drive in a refuge, place the meta-hotspot towards the refuge’s center, sufficiently away from the other hotspots so that users can easily find it and select it.\n\n\n\nMerging Hotspots\nWhen you merge two hotspots, the data from two locations is combined into a single hotspot. For example, if hotspot A is plotted correctly, but hotspot B has a similar name and is plotted nearby (and is a clear duplicate), you should merge hotspot B *into* hotspot A. In almost all cases, you should also select the “Delete after merging” check box so that the hotspot you merged the data from (in this case hotspot B) will be deleted. \nNote: Please be VERY careful when merging and deleting hotspots as this action cannot be reversed. \nALWAYS KEEP MORE REFINED LOCATIONS SEPARATE FROM THE MAIN LOCATION [e.g., DO NOT MERGE “Rocky Mountain NP–Endovalley Campground” into the “Rocky Mountain NP (Larimer Co)” hotspot].\n\n\neBird Hotspot Handbook              |             October 2025             |             Page 3 of 22",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Part II: Standards and Naming Conventions for eBird Hotspots\nWhen approving new hotspots and reviewing current hotspots, try to use names that conform to the naming conventions described below. Consistent naming helps users find the correct hotspot when using the mapping tool to submit a checklist, as well as when selecting hotspots from drop-down lists. Searching for output based on hotspot names is also easier when the naming conforms to consistent standards.\nIt’s also helpful to keep in mind how eBird uses and displays hotspot names. For example, most eBird output (e.g., Hotspot Explorer, Region Explorer) includes the hotspots in geographical context, and when the name of the site is listed, it includes the county, state, and country. Therefore, it is not necessary to include the name of the county, state, province, or country in the hotspot name unless it is needed for clarity. \nHotspot names should generally use the formal, official name of the park, forest, wildlife area, or some other geographic identifier—if there is one. It is generally not good practice to name hotspots for birds that might be seen there or for habitat that may not persist over time, although there may be sites for specific species that do merit a hotspot named for the species of bird. A notable exception is for “stakeout” rarities, which have a special section (Stakeout Hotspots) below.\n\nCapitalization\nWhen in doubt, follow the grammar rules of the local language. In English, eBird hotspots can be considered proper names and should generally be capitalized, including all adjectives, common nouns, and the definite article. Most formal geographic names have two parts, denoting the specific and the generic (e.g., Amherst Marsh). The generic part (“Marsh”, in this example) tells the kind of place, feature, or area to which the name refers, and the specific part (“Amherst”) uniquely identifies the particular place, feature, or area.  Exceptions include articles and prepositions (e.g., Alto de la Cruz, Lake of the Ozarks, Fond du Lac) and phrases that give relative geographic reference  (e.g., Enders Reservoir–below dam, Dartmoor NP–east of Tavistock.)\n\n\nLanguage\neBird is a global project and we recommend that site names be listed in the local language (e.g., Spanish for Central America, Portuguese for Portugal, French for France and Quebec, German for Germany, etc.). These names also should generally match the names used on maps and in local signage. \nHowever, when the local language uses an alphabet that is not easily read by English-speakers (or other Germanic/Romance languages), please list the site name in the local language first, followed by an English translation in parentheses. See examples below:\n\nTaiwan: 宜蘭–頂寮生態公園 (Yilan–Dingliao Ecological Park) http://ebird.org/ebird/hotspot/L3291680\nJapan: 大田区–東京港野鳥公園 (Ota Ward–Tokyo Port Wild Bird Park) http://ebird.org/ebird/hotspot/L927941\n\nNote: Please use accents in non-English words in accordance with correct spelling in the original language (e.g., Río Guadalupe, Parque San José, Cañon San Pedro). Please DO NOT use accents over capital letters. \n\n\nHotspot Definitions and Hierarchy\nMost hotspots are discrete, contiguous sites that accurately represent a geographical region—often defined by land ownership or conservation status. Typical hotspots can also be thought of as representing birder behavior within those properties, including a walking or driving path (i.e., track) and typical strategies for looking for birds. One could theoretically draw a boundary to represent any hotspot (this functionality might be added to eBird in the future to more formally define these areas).\nMost hotspots should be coverable in a discrete birding event, most typically either 1) stationary count at a certain vantage point (e.g., Shaumta Raptor Watchpoint); 2) a traveling count described by a long (e.g., Reserva Ecológica Costanera Sur) or short (e.g., Brooklyn Bridge Park) linear, out-and-back, looped, or meandering walking route; 3) or a traveling count involving short legs by car, bike, or foot that is broken up by stops at key locations or vantage points, such as along a wildlife drive (e.g., Edwin B. Forsythe NWR–Wildlife Drive or Carretero Satipo).\nMany hotspots represent a single, discrete, stand-alone site. However, in some cases there are many hotspots in a small area, and within those areas there may be discrete hierarchy of hotspots that may include:\n\n“List-building” Areas: Representing very large areas, contiguous by land ownership or geography. We refer to these as “list-building” because their use is generally not recommended except for historical records and getting personal life lists up to date (or some current data if birding strategies do not adhere to existing finer-scale hotspots). These should be identified with clear text that recommends using a more specific hotspot.\n\n Example: .\n\nHotspots: Typical eBird hotspots, representing discrete properties, often birded by multiple eBirders using similar birding strategies. \nParent Hotspots: The general, overarching hotspot for a discrete area that also contains multiple individual, precisely-located sub-hotspots within its boundary. Parent hotspots may be represented with “general area” in the name, although this is usually not needed or recommended. Almost all “list-building” areas will be parent hotspots, but only very large and spatially imprecise parent hotspots are considered “list-building” areas. Do not make a large city or town a parent hotspot (but see Towns below). \n\nExample: , a clear and well-known hotspot, typically covered by a walking route that goes past meadows, impoundments, a stretch of beach, marsh, and shrublands, including a couple observation platforms.\n\nSub-hotspots: Hotspots that represent a subset or specific site within a larger parent hotspot. These are most often individual trails, individual lakes or ponds, specific small patches of habitat with specialty birds, or—especially in the tropics—the immediate grounds of a lodge or resort within a larger reserve (e.g., Maasai Mara NR–Governor’s Camp).\n\nExample:  \n\n\nAs a general rule, sub-hotspots should be part of the same management unit, such as a state park, a national wildlife refuge, or a city park. It is also common to have sub-hotspots along particularly good sections of birding roads, rivers, or trails (see Linear Hotspots below). \nHowever, entire “Birding Trails”, covering a large section of a region, should never have sub-hotspots. In the great majority of birding trails, each site or stop on a birding trail should have its own location, either as a standalone hotspot or a sub-hotspot within a local group.\n\n\neBird Hotspot Handbook              |             October 2025             |             Page 4 of 22",
